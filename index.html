            <div class="title">Inflation Rate at British Columbia</div>
            <p>
              CPI is a common indicator of inflation rate. It is the ratio of
              (current price/price of the base period).
            </p>
            <p>
              As you can see, it seldom goes down over the last 6 years.
              Recently the index almost skyrockets -- not a good sign.
            </p>

            <div class="title">12-month % change</div>
            <p>
              A more informative indicator is the change of CPI compared to last
              year.
            </p>
            <p>
              The problem is much more clear -- The growth rate increases
              dramatically in 2022!
            </p>
          </section>
          <section class="step">
            <div class="title">Components</div>
            <p>
              We can calculate CPI for different components, such as food and
              hosuing.
            </p>
            <p>
              Let's only focus on the last 1 year (Oct-21 to Sept-22). Seems
              like the only thing that is more affordable is clothing. But we
              don't buy clothes everyday, right?
            </p>
          </section>
          <section class="step">
            <div class="title">Housing!</div>
            <p>
              Unfortunately, üè†, the component that makes most of our basic
              expenses, has one of the highest 12-month CPI over the last year.
              8.26% means that if your rent is 1600$ last year, it will be
              <b>1732$</b>
              this year.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section class="step">
            <div class="title">Food &amp;Transport</div>
            <p>
              The price of food also rises so much -- It means that if you buy a
              <span>ü•©</span> with 10$ last year, it will cost you 11$ this
              year!
            </p>
            <p>
              üöó has the highest 12-month CPI. Though it does not take up a huge
              amount of our basic expense, it means that
              <b>you cannot choose to live too far away</b> -- and rent is
              soaring!
            </p>

          <section class="step">
            <div class="title">OK. So what about the funding...</div>
            The cost of living in vancouver is really scary. But a poor funding
            can make things worse...
          </section>
          <section class="step">
            <div class="title">Oh no!</div>
            <p>
              From our survey, the funding of
              <span style="color: #db0b0b; font-weight: bold;">47.5%</span>
              graduate students at UBC CS department cannot offset basic
              expenses!
            </p>
            <p>Here, the funding means the sum of TA, RA, and awards.</p>
          </section>
          <section class="step">
            <div class="title">With support...</div>
            <p>
              Some lucky ones get extra financial support, and some have
              internship as additional source of income. All students that
              <span style="color: #2fd3e9;">receive extra support</span> can
              afford basic expenses. Good for them!
            </p>
            <p>
              However, we notice that students that are
              <span style="color: #e61717;"
                >in urgent need for financial support</span
              >
              currently have no extra support available.
            </p>
            <p>
              Also, even those with
              <span style="color: #4bc533;">"always enough"</span> funding, they
              are still very close to the boundary (y=x), which means that it is
              impossible to have saving.

          <section class="step">
            <div class="title">We're feeling unsafe!</div>
            <p>
              88.6% of the respondents are feeling unsafe in current grad
              stipend amount. This is so concerning -- Even students that can
              afford basic expenses with funding still feel unsafe!

            <p>
              It will be a good excuse for UBC to ignore our struggle if
              graduates in other unviersities are in the same trouble. But is
              that the case?
            </p>
            <p>
              Here, we summarize the <b>funding</b> for PhD students in
              different unviersities. It seems that UBC is just in the middle.
